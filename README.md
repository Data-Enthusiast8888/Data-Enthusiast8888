## Hi there 👋


### 👨‍💻 I build real-world tech that feels human — using AI, robotics, and renewable energy to solve challenges in agriculture, finance, and housing.

- 🎓 Currently working on: `smart sorting systems & sustainability tech`
- 🧪 ML Projects: `Tomato Sorting and Grading System, Potato disease detection, Housing price prediction`
- 🔧 Tools I use: `Python, Jupyter, FastAPI, Firebase, Docker, GitHub, React`
- 🌱 Learning: `Cloud deployment, ML model optimization, embedded AI`
- 💬 Ask me about: `AI in agriculture, edge robotics, and building MVPs`
- 📫 Reach me at: [okeyiodhiambo@gmail.com](mailto:okeyiodhiambo@gmail.com)
